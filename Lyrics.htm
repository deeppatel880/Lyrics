<h1><u>Stressed out</u></h1>
     <h2>Twenty One Pilot</h2>
     <p>
          I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard,<br />
          I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,<br />
          I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,<br />
          I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,<br />
          <br />
          I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,<br />
          But now I’m insecure and I care what people think.<br />
          My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think<br />
          <br />
          Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,<br />
          When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.<br />
          <br />
          Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,<br />
          How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from,<br />
          I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it,<br />
          Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one,<br />
